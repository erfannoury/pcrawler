# PCrawler

This is a fork of the awesome [Trenditter](https://github.com/trenditter/trenditter) project, modified to crawl and preserve tweets in Persian.

## TODO
- [ ] Better language identification to differentate between Persian and Arabic tweets, because at the moment, the Twitter language detection cannot with a high accuracy differentiate between Persian and Arabic tweets.
- [ ] Find Twitter bots and remove contributions (tweets, retweets) from them.
